/**
 * Encoding level
 *
 * One-character alphanumeric code that indicates the fullness of the bibliographic information
 * and/or content designation of the MARC record.
 *
 * # - Full level
 * Most complete MARC record created from information derived from an inspection of the physical item.
 *
 * For serials, at least one issue of the serial is inspected.
 *
 * 1 - Full level, material not examined
 * Next most complete MARC record after the full level created from information derived from an extant
 * description of the item (e.g., a printed catalog card or a description in an institutional guide)
 * without reinspection of the physical item. Used primarily in the retrospective conversion of records
 * when all of the information on the extant description is transcribed.
 * Certain control field coding and other data (e.g., field 043 (Geographic Area Code)) are based
 * only on explicit information in the description.
 *
 * 2 - Less-than-full level, material not examined
 * Less-than-full level record (i.e., a record that falls between minimal level and full) created
 * from an extant description of the material (e.g., a printed catalog card) without reinspection of
 * the physical item. Used primarily in the retrospective conversion of records when all of the
 * descriptive access points but only a specified subset of other data elements are transcribed.
 * Authoritative headings may not be current.
 *
 * 3 - Abbreviated level
 * Brief record that does not meet minimal level cataloging specifications. Headings in the records may
 * reflect established forms to the extent that such forms were available at the time the record was created.
 *
 * 4 - Core level
 * Less-than-full but greater-than-minimal level cataloging record that meets core record standards for completeness.
 *
 * 5 - Partial (preliminary) level
 * Preliminary cataloging level record that is not considered final by the creating agency
 * (e.g., the headings may not reflect established forms; the record may not meet national-level cataloging
 * specifications).
 *
 * 7 - Minimal level
 * Record that meets the U.S. National Level Bibliographic Record minimal level cataloging specifications
 * and is considered final by the creating agency. Headings have been checked against an authority file
 * and reflect established forms to the extent that such forms were available at the time the minimal level
 * record was created. The U.S. requirements for minimal-level records can be found in National Level
 * and Minimal Level Record Requirements
 *
 * 8 - Prepublication level
 * Prepublication level record. Includes records created in cataloging in publication programs.
 *
 * u - Unknown
 * Used by an agency receiving or sending data with a local code in Leader/17 cannot adequately determine
 * the appropriate encoding level of the record. Code u thus replaces the local code.
 * Not used in newly input or updated records.
 *
 * For example, code u is used in Dublin Core originated records.
 *
 * z - Not applicable
 * Concept of encoding level does not apply to the record.
