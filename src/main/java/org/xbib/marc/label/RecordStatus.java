/**
 * Record status
 *
 * One-character alphabetic code that indicates the relationship of the record to a file
 * for file maintenance purposes.
 *
 * a - Increase in encoding level
 * Encoding level (Leader/17) of the record has been changed to a higher encoding level.
 *
 * Indicates an increase in the level of cataloging (e.g., code a is used when a preliminary
 * cataloging record (code 5 in Leader/17) is raised to full cataloging level (code # in Leader/17)).
 *
 * c - Corrected or revised
 * Addition/change other than in the Encoding level code has been made to the record.
 *
 * d - Deleted
 * Record has been deleted.
 *
 * n - New
 * Record is newly input.
 *
 * p - Increase in encoding level from prepublication
 * Prepublication record has had a change in cataloging level resulting from the availability
 * of the published item.
 *
 * Example: a CIP record (code 8 in Leader/17)) upgraded to a full record (code # or 1 in Leader/17.)
